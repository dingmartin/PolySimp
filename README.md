# PolySimp
A Tool for Polygon Simplification based on the Underlying Scaling Hierarchy

This program (.exe) is for polygon simplification using its inherent scaling hierarchical levels based on four algorithms which are popular in ArcGIS or open-sourced platforms such as CartAGen and QGIS: Douglas-Peuker, Bend Simplify, Visvalingam-Whyatt, and Hierarchical Decomposition.

How to do:

Load the polygon .shp file into the input field, choose simplification method and related measure for computing, and desired level of details, then click Run. The result will be shown on the right and automatically saved in the same directory with your data files.

Having ArcGIS 10.2 installed is a prerequisite to run the program. Currently, the tool is only compatible with 10.2.

Note that, if choosing Hierarchical Decomposition method, it might take a while to generate the result.
